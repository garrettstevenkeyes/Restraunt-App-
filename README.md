## How to open the project

To open the project you want to local host a server from a chrome canary incognito window. It is important to use this browser because it has cashing features and well options to control throtteling. 

## How I made it

To make this I added some CSS to make the images fit their slide out windows. And from there I set up a service worker and uped the MAPBOX API to include a map into the chart.
